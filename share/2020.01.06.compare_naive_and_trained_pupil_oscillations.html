    <h1>Pupil responses in trained production ophys mice</h1>

    <p>Below is a plot of the pupil response in the 10 seconds preceding and following the omitted flash for each of the
        production ophys sessions. Each colored line represents the average for a given session and the dark black line
        represents the mean of all sessions.</p>

    <h1>Pupil responses in untrained mice</h1>

    <p>The four plots below show the pupil response for each of four sessions with naive (untrained) mice, collected on
        NP1. Each colored line represents one trial (and is thus much noisier than the session averages shown above),
        and the black line represents the average of all trials in the
        session. Note the more condensed x-scale, which inludes only 3 seconds before/after each omitted flash. Also
        note that they y-scale is limited to match the plot above.</p>
